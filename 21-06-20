Example Program:
This program uses linear search algorithm to find out a number among all other numbers entered by user.

/* Program: Linear Search Example
 * Written by: Chaitanya from beginnersbook.com
 * Input: Number of elements, element's values, value to be searched
 * Output:Position of the number input by user among other numbers*/
import java.util.Scanner;
class LinearSearchExample
{
   public static void main(String args[])
   {
      int counter, num, item, array[];
      //To capture user input
      Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
      System.out.println("Enter number of elements:");
      num = input.nextInt(); 
      //Creating array to store the all the numbers
      array = new int[num]; 
      System.out.println("Enter " + num + " integers");
      //Loop to store each numbers in array
      for (counter = 0; counter < num; counter++)
        array[counter] = input.nextInt();

      System.out.println("Enter the search value:");
      item = input.nextInt();

      for (counter = 0; counter < num; counter++)
      {
         if (array[counter] == item) 
         {
           System.out.println(item+" is present at location "+(counter+1));
           /*Item is found so to stop the search and to come out of the 
            * loop use break statement.*/
           break;
         }
      }
      if (counter == num)
        System.out.println(item + " doesn't exist in array.");
   }
}
Output 1:

Enter number of elements:
6
Enter 6 integers
22
33
45
1
3
99
Enter the search value:
45
45 is present at location 3
Output 2:

Enter number of elements:
4
Enter 4 integers
11
22
4
5
Enter the search value:
99
99 doesn't exist in array.
